# Dotfiles

Obviously this is a repository for my configuration files.
Config files are seperated into folders, although most of them only have one file in them, because I wanted to keep the name of the config file as it is.

## My Setup

I have multiple computers with different operating systems and setups.
This is my macbook setup in which I use the config files in this repository.
